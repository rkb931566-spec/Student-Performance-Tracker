# student-performance-tracker
ML project to predict student performance and provide improvement recommendations using feature analysis and classification models.

# 📊 Student Performance Tracker

## 🚀 Student Performance Analysis & Recommendation System

---

# 🎯 Student Performance Prediction System

An intelligent Machine Learning system that predicts student performance and provides **personalized recommendations with explanations (WHY + WHAT TO DO)**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎯 Predicts student performance (Good / Average / Poor)
- 🧠 Explainable AI:
  - WHY the prediction was made
  - WHAT the student should improve
- 📊 Confidence score for each prediction
- 💡 Actionable recommendations based on behavior
- ⚖️ Handles class imbalance using Random Forest

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User inputs:
   - Age
   - Absences
   - Health
   - Social activity (goout)
   - Weekend alcohol consumption (Walc)

2. Model predicts performance

3. System generates:
   - Prediction
   - Confidence
   - Reasons (WHY)
   - Suggestions (WHAT TO DO)

## 🚀 Day 5 Progress

### 🔹 Handling Class Imbalance
- Applied `class_weight="balanced"` in Random Forest
- Improved detection of minority class ("Good" students)

### 🔹 Model Improvements
- Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Random Forest showed best performance (~51% accuracy)

### 🔹 Feature Importance
- Identified key factors affecting performance:
  - Absences
  - Study habits (goout, Walc)
  - Health
- Observed that some features (e.g., age) had indirect influence

### 🔹 Recommendation System
- Built rule-based recommendation logic
- Generates actionable suggestions based on student behavior
- Example:
  - Low study time → suggest increase
  - High absences → suggest reduction

### 🔹 Key Insight
> Model predictions were enhanced by combining machine learning with rule-based recommendations to create a practical student support system.



## 🧠 Learning Progress

- Learned how to handle class imbalance in ML models
- Understood trade-offs between accuracy and fairness
- Implemented feature importance for model interpretability
- Built a basic recommendation engine using model insights
